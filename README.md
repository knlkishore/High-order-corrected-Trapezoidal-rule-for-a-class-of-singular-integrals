 We review the Trapezoidal rule for the computation of definite integral of functions lacking simple anti-derivatives. We then look at complex singular functions and analyze some popular techniques for the computation of its integrals. Furthermore, we look at Trapezoidal rule generalization for various class of complex singular functions.
Then, we see applications of pre-corrected Trapezoidal rule for Direct acoustic obstacle scattering problem in R2 and quadrature rules in determining the numerical solution of Fredholm integral equation of the second kind
